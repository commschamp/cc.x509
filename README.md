# Overview
This project is a member of the [CommsChampion Ecosystem](https://commschamp.github.io/).
It provides necessary [CommsDSL](https://commschamp.github.io/commsdsl_spec) schemas as well as
extra injection code to define the structure of the
[X.509](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280) public key infrastructure certificate.


# How to Build
This project uses CMake as its build system. Please open main
[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) file and review available options as well as mentioned available parameters,
which can be used in addition to standard ones provided by CMake itself, to modify the default build.

This project also has external dependencies. The build process expects to find them in the
provided **CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH** (**CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH** can also be used for path to the commsdsl code generators).
The required dependencies are:

- [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms)
- [commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl) code generators.
- [cc.asn1.commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.asn1.commsdsl) for the ASN.1 definitions.

```
$> cd /path/to/cc.x509.commsdsl
$> mkdir build && cd build
$> cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/comms/install\;/path/to/commsdsl/install\;/path/to/asn1/install
$> cmake --build . --config Release
```

The build process generates another CMake project (hosted as [cc.x509.generated](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.x509.generated))
and builds it. As the result the installation directory will contain only the X.509
certificate definition headers (without the [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms)).

To achieve the same output the [cc.x509.generated](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.x509.generated) can
be used directly. Its only (optional) dependency is the [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms).

There is also a testing application available, which is basically generated by the
**commsdsl2test** code generator. To add it to the build add `-DCC_X509_BUILD_APPS=ON` to the cmake
invocation:
```
$> cmake .. -DCC_X509_BUILD_APPS=ON ...
```
